phpwcms Frontend User Permission
================================

The module **Frontend User Permission** helps to manage frontend user permissions and bind access to specific structure levels. It was used to give customers access to custom content (files, text, newsâ€¦) which is curated by editors.


Setup
-----

Place the module into your installation. You can select it under modules in the backend then.

The simplest thing to get it running in the frontend is to copy and paste the following code to your template (admin section of phpwcms' backend).

```
[PERMITTED]
	{PERMITTED}
	{CONTENT}
[/PERMITTED]
[PERMITTED_ELSE]
	{PERMITTED_ELSE}
[/PERMITTED_ELSE]
```

You have more possibilities by editing the template file of the module (see template/default.tmpl).


Using
-----

Add an user and give permissions by assigning the structure level to which the user should get resctricted access after successful login.
